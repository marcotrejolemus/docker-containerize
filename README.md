# Welcome to `docker-containarize`

Welcome to the `docker-containarize` repository! This project aims to provide easy-to-follow Docker containerization templates and examples for multiple technology stacks, including **Java**, **Python**, and **Oracle Cloud**. The goal is to simplify the process of containerizing applications, making them portable, scalable, and easily deployable across different environments.

Whether you're new to containerization or an experienced developer looking for pre-built solutions to kickstart your projects, this repository is designed to offer flexible, customizable containers for your needs.

## Project Overview

Containerization is an essential practice in modern software development. By encapsulating applications in containers, we can ensure that they run consistently regardless of where they are deployed. This repository demonstrates how to containerize applications built in Java, Python, and even integrate with Oracle Cloud using Docker, making it easier for developers to create production-ready containers that are easy to scale and maintain.

The containerization patterns included in this repository are meant to serve as templates, allowing you to quickly deploy your application in a Docker container without worrying about the underlying infrastructure or configuration details. It also highlights the importance of security, performance, and best practices for containerized applications.

## Technologies Covered

This repository currently focuses on containerizing applications built with the following technologies:

### Java Spring Containerization

The `javaSpringContainerize` directory includes an example of how to containerize a Java application using the **Spring Framework**. Spring is one of the most widely used frameworks for building enterprise-grade applications in Java, and containerizing these applications can help you achieve better scalability and portability.

In this directory, you will find:
- **Dockerfile**: Instructions to build a Docker image for your Java Spring application.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Configuration to easily spin up your application alongside other services, such as databases or message brokers.

### Python Containerization

The `pythonContainerize` directory is dedicated to Python applications. Python is widely used in web development, data science, automation, and more. By containerizing Python applications, you can run them seamlessly across different platforms without worrying about dependencies and environments.

Here’s what you’ll find:
- **Dockerfile**: The necessary setup to containerize a Python application with all required dependencies.
- **docker-compose.yml**: A configuration file to deploy your Python app and any necessary services like Redis, PostgreSQL, etc.

### Oracle Cloud Containerization

In the `OracleCloudContainer` directory, you will find examples for integrating Docker containers with **Oracle Cloud** services. Oracle Cloud provides robust infrastructure and platform services that can be seamlessly integrated into containerized applications. This directory aims to guide developers in deploying their applications to Oracle Cloud.

The contents of this directory include:
- **Dockerfile**: A basic example for containerizing applications intended for Oracle Cloud environments.
- **Oracle Cloud Setup**: Instructions for configuring your Oracle Cloud environment to support containerized applications.
- **Sample Configurations**: Configuration files to set up Oracle Cloud’s infrastructure, such as Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) and Oracle Container Registry (OCR).

## Getting Started

To get started with the repository, follow the steps below to build and run any of the example containers on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:
- **Docker**: Install Docker from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- **Docker Compose** (if you're using multi-container setups): Install it from [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### Cloning the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/docker-containarize.git
cd docker-containarize
```

### Building and Running Containers

1. **Java Spring Container**

   Navigate to the `javaSpringContainerize` directory:

   ```bash
   cd javaSpringContainerize
   ```

   Build the Docker image for the Java Spring application:

   ```bash
   docker build -t java-spring-app .
   ```

   To run the container:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 java-spring-app
   ```

2. **Python Container**

   Navigate to the `pythonContainerize` directory:

   ```bash
   cd pythonContainerize
   ```

   Build the Docker image for the Python application:

   ```bash
   docker build -t python-app .
   ```

   To run the container:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 python-app
   ```

3. **Oracle Cloud Container**

   Navigate to the `OracleCloudContainer` directory:

   ```bash
   cd OracleCloudContainer
   ```

   Build the Docker image for the Oracle Cloud application:

   ```bash
   docker build -t oracle-cloud-app .
   ```

   Follow the instructions in this directory to deploy it to Oracle Cloud.

### Running with Docker Compose

If you'd like to spin up multiple containers for your application (e.g., your app and a database), you can use **Docker Compose**. Each directory comes with a `docker-compose.yml` file that simplifies this process. To start your application with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will automatically build and start all the necessary containers for your project.
